# 🎓 Machine Learning for Education Performance: Dropout Prediction & Enrollment Forecasting

This repository presents a comprehensive **machine learning project** focused on predicting student dropouts and forecasting enrollment trends in the education domain.  
It combines exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for visual insights.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- **Predict student dropout risk** using academic, demographic, and socio-economic indicators.  
- **Forecast future enrollments** for improved academic planning and resource allocation.  
- **Explore datasets interactively** through an intuitive dashboard.  

The repository contains both a **Jupyter Notebook** for step-by-step experimentation and a **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time visualization and interaction.

## 📊 Datasets

Two datasets are included in this repository under the `data/` directory:

1. **Student_Performance_Data.xlsx**  
   - Contains **3 sheets**:  
     - `Demographics` — student background details  
     - `Academics` — grades, attendance, and participation metrics  
     - `SocioEconomic` — parental education and income levels  

2. **Enrollment_Trends_Data.xlsx**  
   - Contains **2 sheets**:  
     - `Historical_Enrollment` — enrollment numbers by year/semester  
     - `Forecast_Inputs` — external factors such as economic indicators or regional data  

🗂️ These datasets are used in both the notebook and Streamlit app to perform:
- Dropout classification modeling  
- Enrollment forecasting and trend visualization  
- Key performance analysis and insights generation
